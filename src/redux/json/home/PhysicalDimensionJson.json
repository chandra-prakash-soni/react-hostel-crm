              "description": "As individuals, our goals are personal to either the sport we play or how fast we can run and how high we can jump. For each age group you reach, there are benchmarks or standards we need to achieve to determine your health and growth abilities. For example, as babies, there are timelines where we start to eat solid food, walk, crawl, and talk, which are all part of this process. During our lessons together, you will learn what these benchmarks are and how to set goals around these benchmarks to continue to help you grow into stronger, faster, and healthier individuals! Disclaimer: the lessons will reference a school setting assessment, which many schools run, but for this course there will be no communication between us, and your school. The assessment will be given as a downloadable PDF, and you or your parents will record the results and tally the score to find your benchmarks. Results will not be shared with schools, and there will not be a formal report sent to your parents. The assessment is strictly used to help you set goals through our lessons.",
