Microaggressions are small hurtful actions that show a lack of understanding and/or respect for an identity and are actually a form of prejudice. However, the person making a microaggression is often unaware of what they are doing. One way this occurs is through tokenism which is when someone with a minority identity is made to represent all people who share the same identity. We already know that two people with the same identity will have very different experiences. So when someone is tokenized, they are put in an impossible position where they are forced to explain or defend what being a particular identity is like for a large group of people. Carrying this burden can lead to embarrassment, frustration, anxiety, and other unfair experiences.</span></p> <p style='text-align:justify;'></p> <p><span style='font-size: 15px;'>Now that you’ve met the characters, and know a little bit about microaggressions, time to enter their reality.</span></p>",
