There are so many topics related to diversity; where does one start to learn? This course is designed to help your child better understand diversity and themselves as they gain the interpersonal skills and confidence to build diverse relationships, self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and self-care.</p>\n<p>We'll start with the concept of intersectionality. That's a big word!  Through an interactive story, your child will unpack what this term means and how it plays out in real life. They will also gain valuable skills to practice social justice interventions and better engage in a diverse world.</p>\n<p></p>",

What does it<br>mean? In this lesson, you will learn about this concept and learn to apply it in<br>real life. The Theory of Intersectionality describes how we all have multiple<br>identities, such as our experiences, characteristics, race, and economic<br>status, that interact to inform how we move through the world. Some of our<br>identities are privileged, and others are oppressed. Intersectionality plays a<br>role on the individual level, but it is due to large systems of oppression and<br>privilege that actually cause particular identities to have more or less<br>privilege and/or oppression. Depending on the unique intersection of one's<br>privileged and oppressed identities, they will experience more or less power in<br>a given environment.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: black;font-size: 10pt;font-family: Arial\", sans-serif;\">Before starting on your intersectional journey,<br>there might be a few words here that you have not heard before. Let's take some<br>time to define them. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>  </strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>What is Privilege</strong></span><span style=\"color: black;font-size: 14pt;font-family: Arial\", sans-serif;\"><strong>?</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong> </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black;background-color: white;font-size: 10pt;font-family: Arial\", sans-serif;\">Privilege refers to unearned<br>benefits that are bestowed upon some and not others because they have<br>identities that are considered more desirable in a given culture. In other<br>words, privilege is like a backpack filled with tools. The more tools you have,<br>the easier it will be to deal with difficult situations that arise. The<br>situations might still be challenging, but dealing with them will be easier.<br>Some of us are born with more tools in our backpack than others, making it<br>easier to do some things. We didn't do anything to earn these tools; we were<br>just fortunate to have them. An example of one of these tools is not having to<br>explain your race to others when you are white, which is white privilege.<br>Another tool is not having to explain why you are attracted to a certain<br>gender; this is an example of straight privilege. Other people were born with<br>fewer tools, which can make life more difficult. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>What is Oppression?</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black;background-color: white;font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial\", sans-serif;\"></span><span style=\"color: black;background-color: white;font-size: 10pt;font-family: Arial\", sans-serif;\">Oppression occurs when one subgroup has more access to power<br>and privilege than another subgroup, and when that power and privilege are used<br>to dominate the other to maintain the status quo (APA, 2022). In other words,<br>oppression occurs when an identity (i.e., specific gender) has less power than<br>another identity(i.e., differing gender) due to a system (prejudice) that<br>delegitimizes (removes respect from) this identity and causes systems and<br>people to treat us unfairly. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black;background-color: white;font-size: 10pt;font-family: Arial\", sans-serif;\">Whereas privilege is having more tools in your<br>backpack even though you didn't earn them, oppression is having fewer tools in<br>your backpack, even though you deserve to have more. An example of oppression<br>is not being able to read a book you want in the library if you are blind<br>because the book you wanted is not written in brail. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black;background-color: white;font-size: 10pt;font-family: Arial\", sans-serif;\">Oppression can lead to some of us having a<br>backpack and some of us having none at all. Additionally, oppression might lead<br>to having a hole in your backpack. There are many systems of oppression; you<br>might have heard of some, such as racism, sexism, heterosexism, ableism\u2026 </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>What is Power?  </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black;font-size: 10pt;\">Power is an invisible force that can provide privilege to some<br>people and oppress others simply based on their race, gender, or other<br>identity, that they have no control over. Power can  both be a result of<br>privilege and oppression and can also add to  privilege and oppression.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: black;font-size: 10pt;font-family: Arial\", sans-serif;\">Power exists as an implicit force which needs to be made explicit<br>in order to change it. This means that people with more privileged identities<br>need to be able to see how they have more power in order to increase<br>fairness. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Having more young men in a space might have given John a feeling of comfort, which Joan did not have access to because of her gender identity as a young woman. It is important to note that no one did anything wrong. However, John was able to use his privilege and power as a young man among a group composed of mostly young men to help Joan feel more included. Joan then used her privilege to help Abe, who might have felt uneasy because they were the only out nonbinary person. She thus used her cisgender (someone who identifies with the gender they were assigned at birth) privilege that everyone else in the meeting had to include Abe. Her same female identity that was previously oppressed was now privileged because of the change in environment, and she was able to use this privilege to empower someone else.",
